# Dawn: Start Your Day With Sunlight
We started brainstorming by looking at the lives of Waterloo students. After all, what better problems to tackle than
ones that we ourselves faced? After discussing various issues, we settled on one common enemy to all students: the
dreaded 8:30 am lecture. How could we help students wake up, and feel more refreshed in the morning?

Introducing: Dawn, an Arduino-based device to incrementally open your blinds in the morning as you snooze your
alarm. Dawn leverages the body’s natural waking mechanism, sunlight, to wake you up energized and ready. It’s also
simple to use, synchronizing to any alarm app you use, and customizable right from your smartphone.
